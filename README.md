# PrinciplesofUX-Assignment-3
Using Bootstrap v5.1.0 to design a reactive website.

In this assignment, we were provided the bootstrap css file, and the initial index.html code. 
The task is to identify which bootstrap classes were used for the website designed, and comment out the ones that are unnecessary. 
The design of the final website for submission of assignment should fulfill the following rubric:
  <ul>
    <li>Text scales according to user defaults [3 marks]</li>
    <li>Grid layout is flexible [3 marks]</li>
    <li>Images resize flexibly [3 marks]</li>
    <li>Media queries used to create at least one breakpoint [3 marks]</li>
    <li>Site works equally well at mobile scale as desktop scale [3 marks]</li>
  </ul>

Keep in mind accessibility when it comes to images, and the 10 heuristics for good user experience design by Jakob Nielsen.
Optional: Try designing your own website with your own content using the template provided by the lecturer, Shakil Ahmed.
